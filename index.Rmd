## Research Experience

### Computational Methods in Statistics and Data Science Research

**Explore Glass Classification and How it Could Aid in Crime Investigation** (January - April 2023)

* Led a detailed analysis of the Kaggle glass dataset, exploring 10 attributes and employing advanced statistical methods
* Utilized 4 methods in R: Monte Carlo Hypothesis Test, Permutation Kolmogorov‚ÄêSmirnov Test, Bootstrap Hypothesis Test, and PermutationTest for Mean Difference to identify the most informative glass attribute
* Implemented data simulation techniques, significantly enhancing model prediction performance and contributing to a nuanced understanding of small group differences

### Analyst of Real Datasets

**Exploring Health Data and Key Influence on Public Health Outcomes** (October - December 2023)

* Applied Lasso regression for feature reduction, incorporated KNN model and regression trees to integrate the findings about the variables shaping the health outcomes into the modeling process
* Analyzed the results from the data and generated 8 figures with clarity and comprehensiveness, providing insights into potential health implications
* Established connections between identified variables and health outcomes to understand the dataset

### Kaggle Competition

**Explore Factors Influencing student performance on a test of US History** (November - December 2023)

* Conducted comprehensive data wrangling, including transforming factor variables into dummies and incorporating squared terms for numerical variables
* Implemented random forest model with 5-fold cross-validation and parameter tuning for optimal performance and achieved a testing R-squared of 0.62
* Applied XGBoost method to improve testing R-squared with a 0.22 increase using regularization techniques and capturing non-linear relationships and exceeded the competition requirement of 0.75

### Statistical Computing Analyst

**Twitter Retweets Analysis of Sitting Member during the 115th Congress** (December 2022)

* Utilized R software and functions like mutate and summarize for in-depth analysis of retweet data related to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and Affordable Care Act (ACA)
* Systematically collected and categorized data on 519 congress members‚Äô chamber, party, gender, state, and birthday, enhancing the comprehensiveness of the analysis
* Identified the most common hashtags and patterns in retweet behavior during the 115th Congress, providing valuable insights for researchers

### American Statistical Association‚Äôs DataFest

**Participate in the Analysis of Large Dataset** (April 2022)

* Used R to subset the dataset to have the cleaned-up data and take less time to perform analyses and visualization, and used Excel to summarize the numerical variables in the dataset
* Led the group to create the final report, adding business values and insights to the project
* Contributed to enhancing data analysis techniques and effectively communicating findings to a diverse audience
